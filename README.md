# ZigZag Lines MTF for MT5

This is a custom indicator called 'ZigZag Lines MTF' developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify and draw support and resistance lines using the ZigZag algorithm on multiple timeframes. The indicator can be used to identify potential breakout levels and trade reversals in the market.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator initialization function sets the necessary properties and buffers for the indicator. It sets the short name of the indicator to 'ZigZag MTF' and the index style to draw lines. It also maps the indicator buffer to the ZigZagBuffer.

## Custom Indicator Iteration

The custom indicator iteration function calculates the ZigZag lines based on the high and low prices of each bar. It determines the current high, low, and close prices and checks if they form a resistance or support level. If a resistance level is detected, a red line is drawn. If a support level is detected, a green line is drawn. The function also draws the current target price as an arrow on the chart.

## Drawing Lines and Targets

There are two helper functions used to draw lines and targets on the chart. The `DrawLine` function creates a trend line object with the specified start and end prices and sets the color. The `DrawTarget` function creates an arrow object at the specified price and sets the color.
